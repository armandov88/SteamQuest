        <h3> Welcome! </h3>
        <p> 
            GameQuest is currently in Alpha testing. This means that certain features are not ready / not implemented. They will be shortly.

            GQ was created with the idea of creating a social network dedicated to bringing Gamers together and to help them find a group of friends that are playing the same games as them. 
            <br>
            Currently, this only supports Steam games, but in the future, I plan on adding other platforms including Origin, Battle.net and many others.
